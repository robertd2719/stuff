git status // status of our commits
git init // start a repository
git add <name> // add a single file
git add . // add all files with changes
git commit -m " //<insert descriptive message string here!!!"
git log // this gives us a log of all our commits
git log --online // this will give a shortened version of the log with smaller lines


reverting
----------
git checkout <id number from log> will take us to an earlier 'read' only 
git checkout main // will return us to the current state of the project

git revert <id> // will revert a certain <id> within the chain with the most recent file
	being one that is a repository with the specified repository taken out
	however, the repository commit is still there we only see what the project
	looks like without that particular commit


git reset <id> // will clean out the repository to a specified commit but the changes
	will not be reflected in the current working files...you could use this to just add everything to one big commit

git reset <id> --hard //will clean the repository and clear out the local working files to 	reflect the commit the reset was pointed at ...nuclear option ...use with caution.
.........

working with branches
----------------------
git branch -a // will give us a list of all the branches
git branch <branchName> // will create a new branch..
git checkout <branchname> // will move us to the new branch
